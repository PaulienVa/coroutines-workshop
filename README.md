# Coroutines workshop: Discovering asynchronous programming with Kotlin

[![YourActionName Actions Status](https://github.com/PaulienVA/coroutines-workshop/workflows/workshop/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PaulienVA/coroutines-workshop/actions)

Asynchronous programming with Kotlin is extremely powerful. Using coroutines, lightweight threads can be used for the execution of non-blocking code. The Kotlin DSL offered by the coroutines library offers an imperative way to write asynchronous code in a maintainable and readable manner. Where Kotlin and especially coroutines are often used in the android applications, it is gaining more and more weight in server-side applications. Well-known frameworks such as Spring are now supporting coroutines, which makes it easy to integrate them in nowadays applications. 
In this hands-on workshop, the basics of coroutines will be explained, the concept of flow will be introduced and the integration with frameworks will be explored.

## What are we going to build?

We are going to build a small cooking application.

## Preparing for the workshop

Required languages and versions:

```text
Java 13
Kotlin 1.4.21
```

The easiest way to do this workshop is to use IntelliJ but other IDE's will also do the job ;)

Some basic knowledge to Kotlin is required to learn the most out of the workshop.
